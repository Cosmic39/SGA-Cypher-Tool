# 🧙 Minecraft SGA Cipher Tool

A standalone **desktop application** for encrypting and decrypting messages using a mix of:

* **Caesar Cipher** (shift-based encryption)
* **Minecraft’s Standard Galactic Alphabet (SGA)** with a seed-based map

Built by **Cosmic**, packaged into a portable `.exe`.
No Python installation required — just download and run.
